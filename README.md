## Description

This is a ReactJS based personal resume website template. I have built this for learning more about reactjs. To customize this web app fork this project or you can download it and fill out your personal information into a json file. Read on to learn how to build your own copy.

### Customization

Data is fed directly from a JSON File called `dataSet.json`. To change the data just replace the values with your own personal information and change will be dynamically fed to your website, you can also replace image,by just copying your image URL.

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
